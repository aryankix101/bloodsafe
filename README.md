# BloodSafe: A Blood Donation Management System

## Purpose
- About 1 in 10 people entering hospitals every day need some kind of blood transfusion
- Donated blood makes its way to patients via complex blood supply chain networks
- Knowing data (i.e. location, condition, patient information, date) is critical
- Transporting this data in a protected manner becomes necessary
- Empowers patient to verify the details of the blood transfused to them

## Inspiration
We were inspired by past studies regarding blood donation cryptocurrencies.

## What it does
We created a blood donation management system. The system revolves around the blood unit production process, which involves a donator, phlebotomist (doctor), blood bank administration, and the smart contract itself.

## How we built it
We used Solidity, Ganache, and Truffle to build this system. Firstly, we created a truffle project. We then researched past papers and what type of metrics they utilized for blood donation management blockchain-based systems. Then, we coded BloodDonation smart contract in Solidity (a programming language used for implementing smart contracts that run on Ethereum) with a variety of values and methods for the Blood Donation system. We finally then migrated the smart contract powered by Truffle alongside Ganache to implement it onto a personal blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into
In the beginning, we didn’t really understand how blockchain worked and how it could be implemented to solve real-life problems. And even what we did know was really limited to general topics like cryptocurrency, so expanding our knowledge in such a dramatic way was something that ate up a lot of hours as we surfed the internet and tried different solutions in our code. Installation was also a process that took up a lot of our time. Because of the fact that we hadn’t worked with blockchain before, we had to newly install many libraries. This, as often happens, led to many errors and issues before we were able to get anything to work.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud that we were able to install the packages needed for this project and that we were able to learn such a great amount of information in a short amount of time.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Blockchain and Solidity, and implement Blockchain to create more accurate and immutable information surrounding blood consumption and its transfer. 

## What's next for BloodSafe
Our product has great room for improvement. The system could be expanded with more intermedial individuals involved, such as a transporter or technician. Additionally, this product could be turned into a web application, where the donator enters their information online and the intermediates are notified about the delivery process.
